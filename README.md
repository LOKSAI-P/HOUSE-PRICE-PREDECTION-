# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDECTION-

Project Overview
Objective:
Predict future house prices by leveraging data from the Federal Reserve and house price data from Zillow. The goal is to develop a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest model, to forecast whether house prices will increase or decrease in the future. The project will involve data loading, cleaning, merging, initial model creation, accuracy estimation, and iterative improvements.

Project Steps:
Load in Data:

Gather data from the Federal Reserve and Zillow.
Federal Reserve data may include economic indicators like mortgage rates, inflation rates, and others.
Zillow data should contain historical house price information.
Clean and Merge Data:

Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
Ensure that the data is in a format suitable for machine learning.
Merge the Federal Reserve and Zillow data based on relevant features.
Create an Initial Machine Learning Model and Estimate Accuracy:

Select features from the merged dataset to serve as predictors.
Define the target variable, which represents the direction of house price changes (increase or decrease).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Random Forest model using the training set.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing set.
Utilize backtesting to measure how well the model performs over time.
Improve the Accuracy of the Model:

Analyze model performance and identify areas for improvement.
Experiment with different features and model parameters to enhance accuracy.
Consider feature engineering to create new predictors that might improve the model.
Use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
Run Diagnostics to Figure Out How We Can Improve:

Conduct diagnostic analyses to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Visualize feature importance to identify key predictors.
Explore potential correlations and interactions between features.
Iterate on the model, making adjustments based on diagnostic findings.
